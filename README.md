# Univid Webinar Platform

The Wbinar Platform project is created with React (the FE side) and Express (the BE side), and it represents a minimal working webinar platform (MVP), which was given by Univid AB as test assignment. For this project, data has been fetched from BE, while the solution is styled via CSS, and is set as responsive for various device/screen sizes.

## Assignment Criteria

These parts needed to be completed for the assignment to be done:

- Already existing messages from API should be displayed
- Messages should be styled
- It should be possible to add new messages to the chat

### To start the project, you need to:

1. Run "npm start" in the main folder (!), this will start the server as well as the client.

```
npm start
```

May have to run following, in case you get the "error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported" error:

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npm start
```

2. Start coding :)
